        name        => 'time_in_days',
        description => 'Duration in days',
        set_by      => 'Contract',
        base_amount => 0,
    });

    my $tiy = Math::Util::CalculatedValue->new({
        name        => 'time_in_years',
        description => 'Duration in years',
        set_by      => 'Contract',
        base_amount => 1,
    });

    my $dpy = Math::Util::CalculatedValue->new({
        name        => 'days_per_year',
        description => 'days in a year',
        set_by      => 'Contract',
        base_amount => 365,
